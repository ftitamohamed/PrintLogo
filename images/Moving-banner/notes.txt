I struggled to create a moving banner exactly when I tried to recreat the image-slider code and I learnt the following things ;

---->  innerHtml is used to transfer a container like : divs , sections ,articles ...  content into another container means it won't work on elt like img/ buttons ...

----> It is ultra-important to wrape your img inside div each  

----> You have to creat a nodeList that will contains all the img : let gallery=querySelectorAll("div");

----> If your nodeList contains img instead of divs you might use the following code to transfer content :
i=0;
btn.addEventListener('click',()=>{
    plat.appendChild(gallery[i]);
    i++;}
